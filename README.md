# Election_Analysis
Python

### Purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of the election audit analysis was to create a code that will run through the date and produce the results.

### Election-Audit Results: 

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

* Which county had the largest number of votes?

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

The clear winner is Diane DeGette, however my code does not reflect the correct winner of the election.  I tried many times to get it to give me the winner and not the last result from code above, but I did not succeed.

* **Election-Audit Summary:** You can reuse this code by changing out the dataset.  You will need to correct the Winning Candidate Summary first, as I was unable to get the code to print the correct winner of the election.  

### In Conclusion:
This challenge was challenging.  I have 2 issues with this code.  The first is the winning results printing incorrectly. The second was the txt file.  I was not able to get the results to go to a text file.  I kept getting error message "ValueError: I/O operation on closed file." .  I was not able to figure out how to fix it.
